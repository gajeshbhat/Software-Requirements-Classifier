# Embedded Systems Project: Smart Home Thermostat
# Notes:
# - Microcontroller: STM32
# - Sensors: Temperature, Humidity
# - Connectivity: Wi-Fi (ESP8266) + Optional BLE
# - Real-time constraints apply to critical temperature controls
# - Power efficiency is crucial (battery-powered)

1. The system shall measure room temperature every 2 seconds.

2. Humidity data should be logged continuously.

3. Wi-Fi should connect automatically when power is turned on.

4. The device must operate within a temperature range of 0°C to 50°C.

5. Users should be able to configure the system remotely.

6. There will be support for over-the-air (OTA) updates.

7. The display should show current temperature and setpoint.

8. Use a secure protocol.

9. The thermostat should respond quickly to temperature changes.

10. BLE connectivity might be added later.

11. Store logs in memory.

12. System boot time must be minimized.

13. Ensure reliability and safety.

14. The device should be small.

15. If the Wi-Fi fails, fallback to BLE mode. (Pending hardware support)

16. Buttons should provide tactile feedback.

17. Provide weekly energy reports to the user.

18. Enable firmware update.

19. It should not overheat.

20. Maintain temperature stability.
